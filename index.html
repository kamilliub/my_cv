                                                During my work in the position as the Master Data Analyst I have undertaken the self determinated goal of transforming existing systems used by team and improving upon those.<br>
                                                As a result I have created Improved and more reliable Database used by the team during Material creation process.<br>
                                                The change resulted in reduced time spend during upload as well as the manual intervention required while interacting with the solution.
