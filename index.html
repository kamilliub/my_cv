                            Primary skilled in development of python automations.<br>
                            I'm an individual who believes that proper business analysis and process transformation is as important to success as automation itself.
                            High scalability of the implemented solutions is important to me and thus I put high priority to maintenance of the documentation and unit tests.
                            I am always happy to share my expertise with my colleagues through code review sessions and discussions regarding solution design.<br>

                            I'm interested in the continuous improvement of myself and acquisition of the new knowledge and betterment of myself.
                            In my free time, I acquire and fine-tune knowledge related to my passion for making games.

                                                During my work in the position as the Master Data Analyst I have undertaken the self determined goal of transforming existing systems used by team and improving upon those.<br>
                                                As a result, I have created Improved and more reliable Database used by the team during Material creation process.<br>
                                                The change resulted in reduced time spent during upload as well as the manual intervention required while interacting with the solution.
